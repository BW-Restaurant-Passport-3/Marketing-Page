                This "pho" place sucks. it made me sick and I threw up all over my moms cat and now my mom kicked me out of her basement so I would highly reccommend staying away from this place. The soup is cold and the sammiches are terrible. I know this is all made up but its still cool to think its not. Im hoping we pass this build week and we get high paying software development jobs in the best companies too. Anyways... gotta go know, thanks for reading this review dawg!!!! lolol why you still reading this! Go do some real work ya nerd!

                The coffee here makes my stomache hurt but the peanut butter and jelly sammiches are to die for! So jammy and so peanut buttery, soooooo good. The bathrooms are very nice and clean plus they have free mints for everyone on tuesdays only! Otherwise they're $5 a pop, not really worth it but you know, gotta stay fresh sonnn!

                If you're into being NAUGHTY and eating unhealthy then this place is the place to be! There is no NICE way to put it... santas workshop has gone off the deep end in a good way lol! The best reindeer raviollis in all of the land! Check your list and check it twice, if Santa's isn't on it you'd better be ashamed!

                Sometimes I don't know if I love this place or this place loves me. I dream about it, its so amazing. The best part is I don't even know where this place is becuase its made up! Lololol why you even reading this? Who knows. Is who knows even a sentence. I'm listening to "the Last of Us" soundtrack while coding all of this. Have you played that video game? If not you definietly should becuase its the best game ever made. Anyways cool story bro, chill lit fam! LOL righteous, shred the gnar gnar dawg.
